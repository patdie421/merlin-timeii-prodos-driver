# What's that ?
This is a PRODOS driver for the AE Time II Clock card.  
This card was build for Apple II/II+ computers with DOS 3.3 and has been replaced in the AE catalog by more efficient clock cards like the TIMEMASTE R II H.O. or clocks integrated in other card (Serial Pro, Z-RAM ultra, ...) usable with PRODOS.  
So there is no official PRODOS support for this card.  
Because I never found a driver for this card I decided to develop it myself.  
# Merlin ?
Merlin.8 was the in 80s and 90s the defacto Macro Assembler for Apple II computer. To understand how programming was done at that time, I decided to do everything from a real Apple IIe, and this is all the more necessary since no emulator simulates this card. 
Auto detect card slot  
Chain the next system (.system) program  
Fully build on Apple IIe with Merlin.8
