# What's that ?
This is a PRODOS driver for the AE Time II Clock card. This card was build for Apple II/II+ computers with DOS 3.3 and has been replaced in the AE catalog by more efficient clock cards like the TIMEMASTE R II H.O. or clocks integrated in other card (Serial Pro, Z-RAM ultra, ...) with PRODOS support.  
So there is no PRODOS support for this card.
