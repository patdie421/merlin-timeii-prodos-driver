This tutorial assumes you know how to use disk images and Prodos files with a real Apple II (IIe or IIc) or an emulator. I use… for macOS or Apple2TS (https://github.com/ct6502/apple2ts) in a web browser.  
The build process, at least for the initial assembly, is relatively lengthy. To simplify it, I used a hard drive image that already contained the necessary tools (and many others...). Since the source code is modular, only partial assemblies are required once the initial assembly is complete.  
* Source organisation

1. Build tools

To build the driver and setup tools you need a copy of Merlin if possible installed on a hard drive.
